Java Projects: Number Game, Student Grade Calculator, and ATM Interface
Task 1: Number Game
Features:

Random Number Generation: Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
User Interaction: Prompts the user to guess the generated number.
Feedback Mechanism: Provides feedback (correct, too high, too low) based on the user's guess.
Gameplay: Allows multiple rounds with a limited number of attempts.
Score Tracking: Displays the user's score based on attempts or rounds won.

Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
Functionality:

Input Handling: Takes marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
Total Marks Calculation: Computes the sum of marks obtained in all subjects.
Average Percentage Calculation: Calculates the average percentage from total marks.
Grade Assignment: Determines grades based on the average percentage achieved.
Result Display: Shows total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade to the user.

Task 3: ATM Interface
Components:

ATM Class: Represents the ATM machine with options like withdraw, deposit, and check balance.
User Interface Design: Implements a GUI for user interaction.
Bank Account Class: Manages the user's bank account, storing the account balance.
